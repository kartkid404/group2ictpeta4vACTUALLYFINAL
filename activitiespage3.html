                <br> The Blood Letting event was held at Britanico Hall in Miag-ao, Iloilo, with Lawigan National High School (LNHS) sending 10 participants, 7 of whom successfully donated blood. <br> The event was part of DAPC Week 20, an initiative aimed at raising awareness about the dangers of substance abuse and promoting a drug-free community. Organized by the Barkada Kontra Droga Organization under the National Drug Education Program (NDEP), DAPC Week featured various activities and campaigns designed to educate students on the effects of drugs and the value of making informed decisions. <br> Throughout the week, activities such as the Pledge of Commitment to a Drug-Free Community and Room-to-Room Campaigns encouraged students to learn, engage, and take a stand against substance abuse. The goal was to foster understanding, provide guidance, and create a supportive environment where students feel empowered to resist peer pressure and make healthy choices. <br>

                Sila ang takbohan sa pagtikom<br>
                Sa mga sugat at mga nararamdaman<br>
                Mga kamay nila ang iyong kaagapay upang ang sakit ay maibsan.<br><br>
                Palaging nakasout ng mga puting roba<br>
                Sa tindig at postura ay naiiba<br>
                Kung iyong titigan sila,<br>
                Ang pagkakamali ang kinatatakutan nila.<br><br>
                Ano mang delobyo o sakuna ang dumating<br>
                Lahat ay gagawin at hahamakin<br>
